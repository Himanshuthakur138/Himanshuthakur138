# Context Api in a Next.js Application
This guide illustrates how to seamlessly integrate the Context API in a Next.js application, empowering you to manage state effortlessly and elevate your app's architecture.
## About Context Api
The React Context API is a built-in feature that allows components to share data without manually passing props through each component. It's useful for sharing data like user authentication, themes, or language settings across an entire app.
