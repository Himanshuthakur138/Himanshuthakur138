# Integrating NextAuth Providers in a Next.js Application
This guide illustrates how to implement authentication in a Next.js application using NextAuth.js. The integration covers multiple OAuth providers including Google, Twitter, and GitHub to offer secure and streamlined user sign-ins.

## About Context Api
The React Context API is a built-in feature that allows components to share data without manually passing props through each component. It's useful for sharing data like user authentication, themes, or language settings across an entire app.
For more detailed information and documentation, visit the [ContextApi Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/react-context-state-management-nextjs).
## Build with
* [Next js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation..
* [MUI](https://mui.com/) - A comprehensive UI library.

##Installation
## To set up this project, follow these steps:
Install of framework and library

## Project Scope
The Context API in React provides a powerful mechanism for sharing data across the component tree without the need for prop drilling. By leveraging context and context providers, developers can streamline state management, improve code maintainability, and enhance the scalability of React applications.
